Created by - Samir Paul

Dataset = CIFAR10 CNN Model used = ResNet18 Used Pytorth Framework

Target was create the code modular and reach Test Accuracy of 85% with constraint on Epochs.

Work done and Results
Created following individual modules for transformations, models, training code and test code and called these modules from main Python Notebook code.

mydatatransformation.py
mymodels.py
mytrain.py
mytest.py
Reached Test accuracy of 85% in Epoch 5, after that there slight drop in accuracy, however from Epoch 10 to 13 , Test Accuracy was consistently above 85%

Ran upto 18 Epochs, Test Accuracy at last Epoch is 86%
